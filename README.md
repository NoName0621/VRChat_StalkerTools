# VRChat_StalkerTools
- This tool was created to stalk (monitor) specific players in a game called VRChat!

# Note
- This is not completely self-made, I modified the code and created it myself while utilizing ChatGPT. Sorry 
- And I can't deny the possibility that the game won't work properly due to API restrictions, so if you use it, do so at your own risk!

# Requirements
- Python 3.13.3 (Python3)
- Install all the dependency needed:<br/>
    `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`<br/>
        or if you fancy to have your dependency installed with root permission<br/>
    `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt` or `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`<br/>
- `TARGET_USER_ID=` `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=`ã€€in **#.env**, please change it, and change `#.env` to `.env` it<br/>
- Get the cookie with `python cookie-get.py` , enter **VRChatName** and **Password** and get it. And **Cookie.txt**, **never** give it to anyone else. **They will hijack your account**.
- Now all you need to do is open `Stalker.py` and you can monitor anyone you like!

# Finally
- This one was created by me as a python beginner, utilizing ChatGPT.
So there is a possibility of a lot of Errors.
If you DM me on X (Twitter) or other, it may be possible to solve this problem 
please!
